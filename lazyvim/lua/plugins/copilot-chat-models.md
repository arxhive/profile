# Copilot Chat Models Breakdown

1. GPT-4 / GPT4.1

```
Capabilities: Strong reasoning, coding, and comprehension

Limitations:
- Slower response time
- High cost and resource-intensive


Use Cases:
- Research
- Legal and technical document analysis
- High-accuracy coding assistance
- Education tools needing deep reasoning
- Often used in enterprise/experimental platforms
```

2. GPT-4.1 Turbo (Better GPT-4)

```
Used In: ChatGPT Plus plan (default GPT-4 mode)

Key Differences from GPT-4:
- Much faster
- Lower cost to run
- Supports longer context windows (up to 128K tokens)
- Backed by a custom, optimized model by OpenAI


Use Cases:
- General-purpose virtual assistants
- Coding assistants
- Enterprise chatbots
- Content generation tools
- Fast, interactive applications with longer memory

```

3. GPT-4.1o (Omni)

```
O = Omni (fully multimodal: text, vision, audio)

Key Features:
- Real-time multimodal input/output: text, images, audio (including video in some tools)
- Fastest and most efficient GPT-4 model
- Much cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo
- High-quality vision model

Use Cases:
- Real-time virtual assistants (voice + visual input)
- Education tools that process voice and handwriting
- Multimodal customer support
- Interactive media and gaming
- Apps that require both voice and visual understanding (e.g., AR, accessibility tools)

```

4. GPT-4.1-mini GPT-4.1-nano

```
Context window: 1 million tokens

Performance:
- Stronger than GPT‑4o on coding and instruction following

Use cases:
- Mini: Long-context workflows (legal, research, book-length docs)
- Nano: Ultra-efficient tasks (high volume chatbots, real-time systems)
- Cost-effective multimodal tasks
- Developers needing robust yet affordable GPT‑4.1 capabilities
```

5. Sonnet 3.7

```
Hybrid reasoning modes:
- Standard mode: fast and direct (improved over 3.5)
- Extended thinking mode: reveals chain-of-thought, great for complex tasks

Context & output:
- Up to 200K token context window
- Up to 64K output tokens (128K output in beta with special header)

Strengths:
- Excellent for coding, math, data analysis, and constraint-rich problems
- Top scores on industry benchmarks like SWE‑bench and TAU‑bench

Toggle:
- Standard mode: fast Q&A, general summarization
- Extended thinking: in-depth reasoning, long-chain logic, heavy code/math tasks
- "Thinking" or "reasoning" mode is not available on the free Claude tier
```

6. Sonnet 4

```
Features:
- Maintains 200K token context window, output up to 64K tokens
- Multimodal: supports both text and images
- Includes extended thinking support like Sonnet 3.7 and improved safety/priority tier
- Higher base reasoning quality
- Better handling of multimodal inputs
- Built-in safety and advanced features from Claude 4 Opus lineage
